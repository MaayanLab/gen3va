                    <p>To get started with GEN3VA, you first need to create a collection of tagged gene expression signatures
                        from GEO using <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/g2e/" target="_blank">GEO2Enrichr</a>. GEO2Enrichr is
                        a browser extension software tool that enables you to easily extract and tag signatures from GEO,
                        automatically adding these signatures to GEN3VA.</p>

                    <h4>Installing and using GEO2Enrichr</h4>

                    <h4>Tags and reports</h4>
                    <p>A <em>tag</em> is a plain text term that you can use to associate multiple signatures from different
                        studies. These tags are non-hierarchical keywords assigned to a gene signature. In social media, the
                        equivalent idea is a "hashtag", which is a tag preceded by a "#" or hash symbol. These tags enable the
                        creation of collections of gene signatures around common themes. A gene signature can have multiple
                        tags. Tagging is handled by GEO2Enrichr and is done when the signature is processed. See <a
                                href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/g2e/manual#tags" target="_blank">GEO2Enrichr's documentation</a>
                        for more details.</p>
                    <p>A <em>report</em> is a GEN3VA page with multiple visualizations and analyses of gene signatures under a
                        single tag. For example, the gene signatures associated with the tag
                        <em>AGING_BD2K_LINCS_DCIC_COURSERA</em> can be found <a
                                href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/gen3va/tag/AGING_BD2K_LINCS_DCIC_COURSERA"
                                target="_blank">here</a>, while the related report can be found <a
                                href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/gen3va/report/approved/AGING_BD2K_LINCS_DCIC_COURSERA"
                                target="_blank">here</a>. A report can also be generated from a subset of signatures associated
                        with a tag. This can be done using the <em>Custom Report Builder</em> on each tag page.</p>

                    <p>Finding consensus across gene signatures profiled under the same or similar conditions by independent
                        studies can address important issues such as data reproducibility, assist in better understanding common
                        biological mechanisms, or facilitate drug discovery by identifying consensus drugs that can mimic or
                        reverse gene expression across a collection of signatures. The key idea underpinning GEN3VA is that gene
                        signatures under a common biological theme may share common properties, such as genes in their gene
                        lists, enrichment terms for gene set enrichment analysis results, or drugs that are predicted to reverse
                        or mimic expression. A <em>report</em> is best understood as aggregated information, a consolidation of
                        metadata, analyses, and visualizations on a collection of gene signatures around a common theme in an
                        attempt to find consensus between signatures.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr/" target="_blank">Enrichr</a> is a web application for
                        performing enrichment analysis on individual lists of genes. The input is a list of genes; optionally,
                        each gene can be followed by a weight indicating the degree of membership in the gene list. The output
                        is a list of enrichment terms from many gene set libraries. GEN3VA performs enrichment vector analysis
                        with Enrichr by submitting each gene signature from a tagged collection in a report and then clustering
                        the resultant terms.</p>

                        molecules that can either reverse or mimic the observed differential expression from the input
                        signature. GEN3VA creates L1000CDS2 hierarchical clustering plots by performing this analysis for every
                        gene signature in the tagged collection and then clustering the scores for mimicking and reversing the
                        expression pattern from the input signatures.</p>
