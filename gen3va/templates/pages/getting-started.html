            <h4>Installing and using GEO2Enrichr</h4>
            <p>GEO2Enrichr is a web application and browser extension designed to ease the extraction of signatures from studies hosted on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) as well as signatures from your own data sets. You can use the browser extension to extract and label gene signatures from GEO and use the web interface to extract signatures from custom data sets. See <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/g2e/" target="_blank">GEO2Enrichr's website</a> for more information and detailed instructions.</p>

            <h4>Tags and reports</h4>
            <p>A <em>tag</em> is a plain text, non-hierarchical keyword assigned to a gene signature. In social media, the equivalent idea is a "hashtag", which is a tag preceded by a "#" or hash symbol. Tags enable the creation of collections of gene signatures around common themes. A gene signature can have multiple tags. Tagging is handled by GEO2Enrichr and is done when the signature is processed. See <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/g2e/manual" target="_blank">GEO2Enrichr's documentation</a> for details.</p>
            <p>A <em>report</em> is a GEN3VA page with multiple visualizations and analyses of gene signatures under a single tag. For example, the gene signatures associated with the tag <em>LIGANDS_BD2K_LINCS_DCIC_COURSERA</em> can be found <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/gen3va/tag/LIGANDS_BD2K_LINCS_DCIC_COURSERA" target="_blank">here</a>, while the report is <a href="http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/gen3va/report/1/LIGANDS_BD2K_LINCS_DCIC_COURSERA" target="_blank">here</a>. A report can also be be generated from a subset of signatures from tags. This can be done using the <em>Custom Report Builder</em> on each tag page.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h4>Understanding the reports</h4>
            <p>The key idea underpinning GEN3VA is that gene signatures under a common biological theme may share common properties, such as genes in their gene lists, enrichment terms for gene set enrichment analysis, or drug targets. A <em>report</em> consolidates metadata, analyses, and visualizations around a collection of gene signatures around a common theme in an attempt to find consensus between signatures. Reports are best understood as aggregated information. The quality of a report is directly linked to the quality of the metadata and signatures collected, which is an on-going process using GEO2Enrichr.
